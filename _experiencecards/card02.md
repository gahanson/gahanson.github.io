title: Designed, implemented and deployed PHP MVC website to select and run test case scripts
section: 1
---
Used CakePHP MVC framework. Front-end used HTML, CSS, jQuery. Back-end used PHP.  
Used LDAP to authenticate users and framework tools to authorized users to login and use parts of the site they were allowed to.  
Part of site allowed users to create individual test cases to run or create test sets to run.  
Once tests selected and run the backend would invoke the Python test case scripts, process the returned results and save the results to a MySQL database.
