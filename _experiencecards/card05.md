section: 1

Metadata for movies and TV is stored in MySQL and MSSQL databases to be used on cable box guides and streaming websites.  
Internal SOAP and REST API’s are used to ingest, process and manage the metadata on Shaw servers.  
I created test cases in SoapUI Pro to test endpoints for internal API’s  
Created by reading and analyzing API documentation, writing a test case and then creating the test case in SoapUI. Any custom code required was written in the SoapUI scripting language, Groovy.
