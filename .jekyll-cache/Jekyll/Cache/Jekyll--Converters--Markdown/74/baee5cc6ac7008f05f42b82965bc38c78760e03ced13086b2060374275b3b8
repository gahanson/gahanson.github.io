I"ã<p>Used CakePHP MVC framework. Front-end used HTML, CSS, jQuery. Back-end used PHP.<br />
Used LDAP to authenticate users and framework tools to authorized users to login and use parts of the site they were allowed to.<br />
Part of site allowed users to create individual test cases to run or create test sets to run.<br />
Once tests selected and run the backend would invoke the Python test case scripts, process the returned results and save the results to a MySQL database.</p>
